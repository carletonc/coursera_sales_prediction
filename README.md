## Intro/Objective
I have not taken the coursera course yet; this is self-driven project to experiment with time series forecasting, time series feature engineering, and familiarize myself with various models and hyperparameter optimization. Models tested will start with common sklearn methods, then timeseries train/validation splits, and eventually move to libraries/toolings I'm less familiar with (Prophet, ARIMA, etc).

Current Models:
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Elastic Net Regression
- SGD Regression
- Random Forests

## Directories
- data - contains 3 sub-directories for data transformations: raw, processed, and final.
- feature_engineering - contains notebooks to explore the data, do some preprocessing, and engineer features. 
- models - contains notebooks optimizing various models.
- src - source code for feature engineering and experimenting with model optimization.

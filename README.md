 - [Coursera Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science)
 
## Intro/Objective
I have not taken the coursera course yet, this is self-driven project to experiment with time series prediction, feature engineering, and to familiarize myself with various models and hyperparameter optimization.

## Directories
- data - contains 3 sub-directories for data transformations: raw, processed, and final.
- feature_engineering - contains notebooks to explore the data, do some preprocessing, and engineer features. 
- models - contains notebooks optimizing various models.
- src - source code for feature engineering and experimenting with model optimization.
